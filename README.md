### Challenge

AppleTree aims to address three challenges raised by the UN Sustainable Development Goals: Goal 13 (Climate Action), Goal 15 (Life on Land) and Goal 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy).

### Solution

AppleTree provides a tool to evaluate the actions taken by an individual or an organisation towards meeting the SDGs and assign them credits which they can use in their daily lives.

### NASA Resources used

AppleTree uses MOD13C2 (MODIS/Terra Vegetation Indices Monthly L3 Global 0.05 Deg CMG)'s Vegetation indices and OCO-2 (Orbiting Carbon Observatory)'s measurements of atmospheric CO2 for the "Plant a tree" action. They provided good insights on planting trees in a particular location.

### Built with

PHP, JavaScript, Plotly.js, HTML, CSS

### Future plans

AppleTree aims to expand the number of actions to other related areas. Together, it will measure the actions taken by an individual or an organisation towards building a sustainable world and assign them credits accordingly. These credits can be used in many ways to gain incentives, for eg. to purchase e-vehicles, to gain academic points, HR credits, etc.
